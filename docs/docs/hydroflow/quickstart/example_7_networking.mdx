# Networked Services

Hydroflow provides a robust framework for developing networked services. The best way to get started is to use
the Hydroflow template.

```bash
cargo generate hydro-project/hydroflow-template
```

The template contains a chat server & client implementation using UDP. You can start multiple instances of
the client and connect to the same server.

## Things to Check
* [README](https://github.com/hydro-project/hydroflow-template) - Contains instructions on building the template and
running the client and server examples.
* [server.rs](https://github.com/hydro-project/hydroflow-template/blob/main/src/server.rs) - Contains the chat server
implementation. The inline rust documentation explains the networking-related hydroflow operators and their usage.
* [client.rs](https://github.com/hydro-project/hydroflow-template/blob/main/src/client.rs) - Contains the chat client
implementation. The inline rust documentation explains the networking-related hydroflow operators and their usage.

Hydroflow also supports TCP for reliable, connection-oriented communication. Understanding the differences and use
cases of these protocols can help you choose the right one for your networked service.

## Additional Examples

The Hydroflow examples directory contains additional examples that deal with networking. For example, the [Randomized
Gossip Server](https://github.com/hydro-project/hydroflow/blob/main/hydroflow/examples/chat/randomized_gossiping_server.rs)
example extends the chat example to work with a cluster of redundant servers that use gossip for sharing chat-related
state between themselves.
