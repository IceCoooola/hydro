# Quickstart
This section will get you up and running with Rust and Hydroflow, and work you through a set of concrete examples illustrating much of what you need to know to get productive with Hydroflow.

Hydroflow is the low-level IR that forms the foundation of the Hydro stack. If you're looking for a higher-level API, check out [Hydroflow+](../../hydroflow_plus/index.mdx).
