# Introduction

<HydroflowDocs />

## This Book
This book will teach you how to set up your environment to get started with Hydroflow, and how to program in the Hydroflow surface syntax.

Keep in mind that Hydroflow is under active development. However the code in this book is tested with the Hydroflow library so should always be up-to-date.

If you have any questions, feel free to [create an issue on Github](https://github.com/hydro-project/hydroflow/issues/new).
