# Embedding a Flow in Rust
Hydroflow's surface syntax is typically used within a Rust program. (An interactive client and/or external language bindings are TBD.)

The surface syntax is embedded into Rust via a macro as follows

<CodeBlock language="rust" showLineNumbers>{getLines(exampleCode, 3, 10)}</CodeBlock>

The resulting `flow` object is of type [`Hydroflow`](https://hydro-project.github.io/hydroflow/doc/hydroflow/scheduled/graph/struct.Hydroflow.html).
