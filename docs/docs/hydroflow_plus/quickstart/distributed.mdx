# Adding Distribution
Continuing from our previous example, we will now look at how to extend our program to run on multiple processes. Recall that our previous flow graph looked like this:

<CodeBlock language="rust" title="flow/src/first_ten.rs">{getLines(firstTenSrc, 3, 14)}</CodeBlock>

## The Flow Graph
Let's extend this example to print the numbers on a separate process. First, we need to specify that our flow graph will involve the network. We do this by replacing the `LocalDeploy<'a>` trait bound with the general `Deploy<'a>`. Then, we can use the `process_spec` to create a second process:

<CodeBlock language="rust" title="flow/src/first_ten_distributed.rs">{getLines(firstTenDistSrc, 1, 9)}</CodeBlock>

Now, we can distribute our dataflow by using the `send_bincode` operator to mark where the data should be sent using bincode serialization.

<CodeBlock language="rust">{getLines(firstTenDistSrc, 11, 14)}</CodeBlock>

## The Runtime
Now that our graph spans multiple processes, our runtime entrypoint will involve multiple subgraphs. This means we can't get away with just the optimized dataflow. Instead, we must take the subgraph ID as a runtime parameter through `with_dynamic_id` to select the appropriate graph. In addition, our dataflow involves the network, so we take a `HydroCLI` runtime parameter (`cli`) so that processes can look up their network connections and instantiate the flow graph with access to it.

In a new file:

<CodeBlock language="rust" title="flow/src/first_ten_distributed.rs">{getLines(firstTenDistSrc, 19, 31)}</CodeBlock>

The corresponding binary in `src/bin/first_ten_distributed.rs` then instantiates the CLI and reads the process ID from the command line arguments:

<CodeBlock language="rust" title="flow/src/bin/first_ten_distributed.rs">{firstTenDistBin}</CodeBlock>

## The Deployment
Finally, we need to deploy our dataflow with the appropriate network topology. We achieve this by using [Hydro Deploy](../../deploy/index.md). Hydroflow+ integrates with Hydro Deploy to automatically construct the topology based on the flow graph. We can create a new file `examples/first_ten_distributed.rs` with the following contents:

<CodeBlock language="rust" title="flow/src/examples/first_ten_distributed.rs">{firstTenDistExample}</CodeBlock>

Most importantly, we specify a `DeployProcessSpec`, which takes a closure that constructs a Hydro Deploy service for each process in the flow graph. In our case, we use the `HydroflowCrate` service type, which deploys a Hydroflow+ binary. We also specify the process ID as a command line argument, which is read by our runtime binary.

We can then run our distributed dataflow with:

<>{/* TODO(mingwei): grab this output from a tested snapshot file */}</>

```bash
#shell-command-next-line
cargo run -p flow --example first_ten_distributed

[service/1] 1
