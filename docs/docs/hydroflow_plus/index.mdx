# Introduction
Hydroflow+ layers a high-level Rust API over the Hydroflow IR, making it possible to write dataflow programs that span multiple processes with straightline, functional Rust code. Hydroflow+ is built on top of [Stageleft](./stageleft.mdx), which allows Hydroflow+ to emit regular Hydroflow programs that are compiled into efficient Rust binaries. It also integrates with [Hydro Deploy](../deploy/index.md) to make it easy to deploy and run Hydroflow+ programs on a cluster.

The main logic of Hydroflow+ programs manipulates **streams**, which capture infinite ordered sequences of elements. Streams are transformed using classic functional operators such as `map`, `filter`, and `fold`, as well as relational operators such as `join`. To build **distributed** dataflow programs, Hydroflow+ also introduces the concept of **processes**, which capture _where_ a stream is being processed.

## Setup
Hydroflow+ requires a particular workspace setup, as any crate that uses Hydroflow+ must have an supporting macro crate to drive the code generation. To get started, we recommend using the Hydroflow+ template.

```bash
#shell-command-next-line
cargo install cargo-generate
#shell-command-next-line
cargo generate hydro-project/hydroflow-plus-template
```

Then, you can test the example dataflow:

```bash
#shell-command-next-line
cargo test
```
