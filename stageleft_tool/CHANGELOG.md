## v0.1.0 (2024-01-29)

<csr-id-add8e602cbef513d1faa45f016a4e46d8bb5be6c/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-add8e602cbef513d1faa45f016a4e46d8bb5be6c/> Commit empty CHANGELOG.md

### New Features

 - <csr-id-af6e3be60fdb69ceec1613347910f4dd49980d34/> push down persists and implement Pi example
   Also fixes type inference issues with reduce the same way as we did for fold.
 - <csr-id-c50ca121b6d5e30dc07843f82caa135b68626301/> split Rust core from Python bindings
 - <csr-id-71083233afc01e0132d7186f4af8c0b4a6323ec7/> support crates that have no entrypoints
   Also includes various bugfixes needed for Hydroflow+.
 - <csr-id-e5bdd12e32d6ea72fd91a55c12e09f07a0edaa5c/> add initial test using Hydro CLI from Hydroflow+
   This also required a change to Hydroflow core to make it possible to run the dataflow itself on a single thread (using a LocalSet), even if the surrounding runtime is not single-threaded (required to work around deadlocks because we can't use async APIs inside Hydroflow+). This requires us to spawn any Hydroflow tasks (only for `dest_sink` at the moment) right next to when we run the dataflow rather than when the Hydroflow graph is initialized. From a conceptual perspective, this seems _more right_, since now creating a Hydroflow program will not result in any actual tasks running.
   
   In the third PR of this series, I aim to add a new Hydroflow+ operator that will automate the setup of a `dest_sink`/`source_stream` pair that span nodes.
 - <csr-id-8b635683e5ac3c4ed2d896ae88e2953db1c6312c/> add a functional surface syntax using staging
